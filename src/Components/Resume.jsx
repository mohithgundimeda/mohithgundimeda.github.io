          <span style={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}>CalorieVision</span><br />
          Designed and implemented a protein-tracking web application leveraging Flask for the backend and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for an intuitive frontend. The application enables users to upload images or use their camera to obtain food item predictions. Flask manages these requests, interfacing with a TensorFlow-based deep learning model for accurate identification of food items. SQLAlchemy supports the backend with a structured database that stores nutritional information, empowering users to monitor their protein intake and make informed dietary choices.

          <span style={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}>Custom Transformer Model Design</span><br />
          Developed a transformer-based language model that incorporates multiple self-attention heads and feedforward layers, along with layer normalization to enhance performance. Created functions for efficient data processing, including vocabulary encoding and splitting datasets into training and validation sets. Configured key training parameters, such as batch size, learning rate, and dropout rate, to improve model generalization. Implemented a loss estimation function to monitor training and validation losses throughout the training process. Enabled text generation capabilities, allowing the model to predict the next tokens based on user input. Optimized the implementation for GPU compatibility with CUDA, significantly accelerating computations. (Source code available on GitHub)
